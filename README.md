# Platypus TODO:

1. List objects the platypus is holding on screen
2. Illegal commands should have an error message (e.g., front is not clear when hitting land or going out of bounds)
3. Add starter code to world definitions
4. Examples and exercises
5. Clean up code
6. Add count for objects, e.g., `how_many('egg')` returns the number of eggs the platypus is holding.
7. Add `all_items_held()` which returns a `dict`, e.g., `{'egg': 4, 'crab': 1}
